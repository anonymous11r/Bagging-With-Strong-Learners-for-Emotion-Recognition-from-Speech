# Bagging-With-Strong-Learners-for-Emotion-Recognition-from-Speech

Speech emotion recognition, a highly promising and exciting problem in the field of Human Computer Interaction, has been studied and analyzed over several years, and concerns the task of recognizing a speaker's emotions from their speech recordings. Recognizing emotions from speech can go a long way in determining a person's physical and psychological state of well-being, and also provides us with valuable information regarding language etc. In this work we analyzed three corpora - the Berlin EmoDB, the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Simulated Emotion Hindi Speech Corpus (IITKGP-SEHSC) and the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), and extracted spectral features from them which were further processed and reduced to the required feature set by using Boruta, a wrapper-based feature selection method. We propose a bagged ensemble comprising of Support Vector Machines with a Gaussian kernel as a viable algorithm for the problem at hand, and report the results obtained on the three datasets above.
